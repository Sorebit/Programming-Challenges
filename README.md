# Programming-Challenges
Using /g/'s huge list of programming challenges, I aim to complete almost every single one in either python, C or C++

A link to the challenges is hosted on [imgur](http://i.imgur.com/FjhA208.png)

### Compiling
Enter directory with challenge number and run `make`

It will create an executable *.app

### Solutions with their own repos
